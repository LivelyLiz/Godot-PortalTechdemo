# Godot Portal Techdemo
A ~non-euklidean geometry project (hopefully game)~ tech demo for a first try with portals made with Godot 3.1.1 (and Godot in general).

This was made on a GameJam (hence the commit messages) so it isn't refined in the slightest. It sometimes fails to teleport and you can see artifacts. The camera setup probably isn't correct either but if you are close to a portal, it looks somehow realistic ^^ 

Inspired by [CodeParade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEB11PQ9Eo8) and [EricPlayZ's](https://github.com/EricPlayZ/NonEuclidean-Godot) project but with a different approach to rendering than the latter one. We do not use other geometry than that one already in the scene.
